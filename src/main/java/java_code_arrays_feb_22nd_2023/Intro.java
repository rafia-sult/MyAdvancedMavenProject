	 * What is Array? 
	 * - An array is an object that holds a fixed number of values of homogeneous data type 
	 * - A data structure where we store similar/homogeneous elements 
	 * - length of an array is assigned when we create the array 
	 * - once you have assigned a length you cannot change it during runtime or anything 
	 * - its represented by [] brackets 
	 * 
	 * all arrays are stored in the heap memory 
	 * whenever we use the new keyword the object is always stroed in heap memory 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * features of Array 
	 * - variables in the array are ordered format
	 * - indexing begins from 0 
	 * - they occupy memory in Heap Memory Area
	 * - superclass of an Array type is Object 
	 * - object class is a superclass of all the classes. They are created at Runtime 
	 * - to determine length - .length 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Advantages of Array: 
	 * 1. you can store multiple data 
	 * 
	 * Disadvantages of Array 
	 * 
	 * GOOGLE AND LEARN ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES 
	 * 
	 * Types of array: 
	 * - single dimensional 1-D array 
	 * - multi dimensional 2-D, 3-D array 
	 *
